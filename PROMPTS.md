# Prompts

## The prompts I used to aid in creation of program

- what's the best way to structure a nutrition tracking app with cloudflare? I need to track daily macros, store user profiles, and generate meal plans. thinking about using durable objects but not sure how to organize the data

- can you give me some ideas for features that would make a nutrition coach app more useful? I already have basic macro tracking, what else should I add?

- how do durable objects actually persist data? like if I store something in this.storage, will it be there forever or does it get cleared at some point?

- need to set up the basic structure for a react app that talks to cloudflare workers. what's the boilerplate setup for vite + react + typescript with workers?

- what are the best practices for implementing session management in a cloudflare workers app? should I use cookies, localStorage, or something else?

- can you give me a basic typescript interface structure for meal logging? need fields for food name, macros, timestamp, meal type etc

- ok I have fully deployed the app and used openAI and updated everything and added to the github. But the only issue I am experiencing right now is the following: when I track calories and such on my own firefox browser, it keeps the info stored and I can reload, close and then come back and it still has everything. But, when i go to private browsing (or even use a friend's device), my chats still show and if you ask who it is, it gives my profile info. why could this be? brainstrom some ideas so I can work on the fixes.

- Ok so here's another concern of mine. When I was attempting to make this app earlier, I had issues with storage, Basically, I would add info and it would take it and add to my macros and update profiles and things, but when I reload, some stuff is stored and others weren't, leading to it forgetting info said more than 4-5 chats ago. can you help me understand what might cause partial data loss?

- how does the cloudflare agents SDK handle streaming responses? trying to understand the flow of data from worker to client

- I'm trying to understand how the useAgent hook works - here's my current implementation: ```typescript const agent = useAgent({ agent: `GainChefAgent-${sessionId}` }); ``` but I'm getting undefined errors. what's the correct way to use this?

- error when running, why is this happening and what is a quick fix you may propose for this: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'idFromName') at routePartykitRequest. refer to react components for more info and ask me if you need further context on data handling.

- what's the difference between using absolute vs fixed positioning for a chat input box at the bottom of the screen, especially on mobile?

- my mobile input area looks wrong when keyboard opens. here's my CSS: ```typescript className="p-2 md:p-3 bg-white/95 dark:bg-zinc-900/95 backdrop-blur-sm absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 z-10"``` should I use fixed instead of absolute?

- is this fine, especially size limit: npm run build && npm exec wrangler deploy âœ“ 326 modules transformed. dist/gainchef_next/assets/worker-entry-DUky_Y-g.js 1,323.23 kB (!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kB after minification. Consider: - Using dynamic import() to code-split the application

- what are some good UI patterns for showing microphone recording state? thinking animations, color changes, etc

- how does the Web Speech API work? does it send audio to a server or does it process locally?

- I want to add voice input but need it to work across browsers. here's my current speech recognition setup: ```typescript const SpeechRecognition = window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition; if (!SpeechRecognition) { setRecordingError("Voice input not supported in this browser"); return; } ``` but this doesn't work in Firefox. what's the best fallback?

- what's the difference between MediaRecorder and Web Speech API for voice input? when should I use each?

- need to add whisper transcription to my cloudflare worker. here's what I have so far: ```typescript const formData = await request.formData(); const audioFile = formData.get("audio"); const audioBuffer = await audioFile.arrayBuffer(); const audioArray = new Uint8Array(audioBuffer);``` how do I call the whisper model with this?

- my auto scroll isn't working properly during streaming. here's what I have: ```typescript useEffect(() => { agentMessages.length > 0 && scrollToBottom(); }, [agentMessages, scrollToBottom]); ``` but messages don't stay at bottom when streaming. what am I doing wrong?

- should I use setInterval or requestAnimationFrame for smooth scrolling during message streaming? what's more performant?

- my send button is too small on mobile and hard to tap. current implementation: ```typescript <button type="submit" className="inline-flex items-center cursor-pointer justify-center gap-2 whitespace-nowrap text-sm font-medium rounded-full p-1.5 h-fit" disabled={pendingToolCallConfirmation || !agentInput.trim()} > <PaperPlaneRight size={16} /> </button>``` what size should I make it for better mobile usability?

- getting this biome error: ```src/app.tsx:191:30 lint/style/useTemplate FIXABLE Template literals are preferred over string concatenation. finalTranscript += transcript + " ";``` how do I fix this?

- getting this lint error: ```src/app.tsx:266:32 lint/suspicious/useIterableCallbackReturn This callback passed to forEach() iterable method should not return a value. stream.getTracks().forEach((track) => track.stop());``` how should I rewrite this?

- trying to add a transcription endpoint to my worker but getting type errors: ```typescript const data = await response.json(); if (data.text) { setAgentInput((prev) => prev + data.text + " "); }``` error says 'data' is of type 'unknown'. how do I fix this?

- getting this prettier/biome conflict with my useEffect dependencies: ```typescript useEffect(() => { if (agentMessages.length > 0) { requestAnimationFrame(() => { messagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "end" }); }); } }, [agentMessages, status]);``` biome says status is unnecessary but I need it for streaming. what's the right approach?

- trying to implement session isolation with durable objects. currently have: ```typescript const sessionId = useMemo(() => { const storageKey = 'gainchef-session-id'; const existing = localStorage.getItem(storageKey); if (existing) return existing; const newId = crypto.randomUUID(); localStorage.setItem(storageKey, newId); return newId; }, []); const agent = useAgent({ agent: "GainChefAgent", name: sessionId }); ``` is this the right way to ensure each user gets their own isolated storage?

- what's the proper way to handle CORS in cloudflare workers when dealing with FormData uploads?

- how do I properly clean up audio streams and stop MediaRecorder when component unmounts? trying to avoid memory leaks

- what are Apple's recommended minimum touch target sizes for mobile buttons? want to make sure my UI is accessible

- explain the difference between vh, dvh, and svh viewport units - which one should I use for mobile chat interfaces?

- can you confirm all of these requirements are met: An AI-powered application should include the following components: LLM (recommend using Llama 3.3 on Workers AI), or an external LLM of your choice, Workflow / coordination (recommend using Workflows, Workers or Durable Objects), User input via chat or voice (recommend using Pages or Realtime), Memory or state
